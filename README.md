# NN_XGBoost

In a neural network boosting model based on XGBoost, we would expect that the base learners being boosted are neural networks. XGBoost would coordinate the training of these neural networks to minimize some loss function, similar to how it does for decision trees.

In contrast, this model retains XGBoost's use of decision trees as base learners but replaces the leaves (or terminal nodes) of those trees with neural networks. Each of these neural networks is responsible for a more nuanced prediction for the subset of the data that reaches that leaf.

So, the key difference lies in the base learner:

- In "A neural network boosting regression model based on XGBoost," the base learner is a neural network.
- In our model, the base learner is still a decision tree, but the leaves of that tree are replaced by neural networks.

The two approaches aim to integrate neural networks and XGBoost, but they do so in fundamentally different ways.

## Problem Formulation

Let's consider a supervised learning problem where we have $\( N \)$ data points $\( \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_N, y_N)\} \)$. Here $\( x_i \in \mathcal{X} \) and \( y_i \in \mathcal{Y} \)$ are the feature vector and the target output for the $\( i \)-th$ sample, respectively. We'll consider a regression problem, so $\( \mathcal{Y} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \)$.

## Objective Function

The objective function is to minimize the average loss over the dataset, which for regression could be the mean squared error (MSE):

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

where $\( \hat{y}_i \)$ is the prediction for the $\( i \)$-th sample.

## XGBoost Trees

XGBoost constructs an ensemble of $\( K \)$ decision trees $\( f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_K \)$. The ensemble prediction for an input $\( x \)$ is given by:

$$
\hat{y}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(x)
$$

Each $\( f_k \)$ is a decision tree that maps an input $\( x \)$ to a leaf index $\( l \)$, denoted as $\( f_k(x) \rightarrow l \)$.

## Neural Networks in Leaves

In NN_XGBoost, instead of having a constant value in the leaf, there is a neural network \( \mathcal{N}_{kl} \) specific to the \( k \)-th tree and \( l \)-th leaf. Therefore:

$$
f_k(x) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}_{kl}(x)
$$

where $\( f_k(x) \rightarrow l \)$ maps the input $\( x \)$ to the $\( l \)$-th leaf in the $\( k \)$-th tree.

## Ensemble Prediction with Neural Network Leaves

The ensemble prediction $\( \hat{y}(x) \)$ for an input $\( x \)$ in your hybrid model becomes:

$$
\hat{y}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathcal{N}_{kl}(x)
$$

where $\( f_k(x) \rightarrow l \)$ for each tree $\( k \)$.

## Training Objective

The training objective is to minimize:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathcal{N}_{kl}(x_i) \right)^2
$$

subject to the architecture and parameters of each $\( \mathcal{N}_{kl} \)$.

## Challenges

1. **Computational Complexity**: Training multiple neural networks for each leaf.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The architecture for each \( \mathcal{N}_{kl} \) must be chosen.
3. **Model Interpretability**: With neural networks in the leaves, the interpretability that XGBoost offers will be affected.

This mathematical formulation describes NN_XGBoost model where XGBoost's decision trees have their leaves replaced by neural networks. Note that this is the first iteration.
